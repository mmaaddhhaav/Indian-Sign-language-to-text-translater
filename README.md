# Indian Sign Language to Text Translator

## Project Overview:
This project aims to **translate Indian Sign Language gestures into text** using machine learning. The dataset consists of **images of different signs**, which are used for training and evaluation.

## Dataset:
>>Stored in the `dataset/` folder.
>>Contains images representing **various sign gestures**.
>>Used to train the recognition model.

## Visualizations:
This project includes several **data visualizations**:
1. **Bar Chart** – Shows the number of images per gesture category.
2. **Scatter Plot** – Displays model accuracy across training epochs.
3. **Pie Chart** – Represents the distribution of different gestures in the dataset.

## How to Run Visualizations:
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly opencv-python pandas numpy
